### The Architecture

PixlHub uses a structured hierarchy to maintain order across large-scale data operations:

- **Organizations:** The highest administrative level. This is where teams, permissions, and multiple workspaces are managed.
- **Projects:** The operational hub for specific labeling goals. Each project contains a unique **Ontology** (classes and attributes) and specialized annotation tools.
- **Datasets & Assets:** The library of raw source files. Assets are uploaded once and can be utilized across multiple projects without data duplication.

**Tasks:** The actual unit of production. PixlHub separates _Assets_ from _Tasks_, allowing for diverse labeling objectives to be generated from the same raw source material.\
\
**Optimized Annotation Flow** The interface is built for speed. With a keyboard-first design and a high-performance canvas, the platform remains fluid even when handling complex polygons or hundreds of objects in a single frame.

**Integrated Quality Control** Quality is enforced through a dedicated **Review Workflow**. Managers can track every label in real-time, providing feedback, rejecting errors, or approving completions to ensure the final output meets strict accuracy thresholds.

**Operational Insights** Project progress is monitored through live dashboards. PixlHub provides granular analytics on label distribution, annotator velocity, and time-per-task, offering full visibility into the project lifecycle.
