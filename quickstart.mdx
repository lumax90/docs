### 1. Create an Organization

The first step is setting up an **Organization**. This acts as the primary workspace where team members are managed and projects are hosted. Once the organization is created, it serves as the central hub for all data operations.

### 2. Setup a Project

Inside the organization, create a new project to define the workspace:

- **Tool Type:** Choose the primary format (Image, Video, or Text).
- **Ontology:** Define the classes (e.g., "Vehicle") and attributes (e.g., "Color") that will be used for labeling.

### 3. Import Data (Assets to Tasks)

PixlHub simplifies the workflow by automatically converting uploaded files into actionable tasks.

- **Default Import:** When raw files (**Assets**) are uploaded, PixlHub automatically creates tasks for them and places them in the **Label** status.
- **Prelabel Import:** If existing annotations are being migrated into PixlHub, they can be imported into the **Prelabel** status for further refinement.

### 4. Start Labeling

There is no need to manually assign work. When a user clicks **"Start Labeling"** on the project dashboard, PixlHub automatically assigns the next available task from the queue to that user.

### 5. Task Lifecycle

Each task moves through a specific lifecycle based on its current progress. Understanding these four statuses is key to managing the project:

- **Prelabel:** Reserved for imported data that already contains initial annotations.
- **Label:** The default starting point. Tasks in this status are in the queue, waiting to be picked up and labeled by a user.
- **Review:** Once a user submits their work, the task moves to this status. It indicates the task is labeled but requires manager approval.
- **Complete:** Tasks that have passed the review process and are finalized. These are ready for export.
