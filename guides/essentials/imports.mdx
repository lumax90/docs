title: "Imports"
---

The **Import** page allows you to bring existing annotations from external sources or previous projects into PixlHub. Whether you are migrating a dataset or utilizing pre-labeled data, the import system ensures that labels are correctly mapped to your current assets.

### **Pre-Import Checklist**

To ensure a successful data merge, follow these preparation steps:

- **Task Status:** Change the status of the target tasks to **"Prepare."** Annotations can only be imported into tasks that are in this stage to prevent overwriting active work.
- **Format Selection:** Prepare your annotation files in one of the supported formats: **PixlHub Native (JSON)**, **COCO**, or **YOLO**.

### **Import Workflow**

The system follows a four-step verification process to maintain data integrity:

1. **Upload:** Drag and drop or click to upload your annotation file (Native JSON or COCO/YOLO formats).
2. **Review Validation:** PixlHub automatically parses the file and provides a validation report. This shows how many labels were found and how they align with your current project.
3. **Conflict Check:** Review any warnings regarding unmatched filenames or ID discrepancies.
4. **Confirm:** Once the validation results are reviewed, click confirm to apply the annotations to your tasks.

### **Supported Formats & Matching Logic**

The accuracy of an import depends on the format and the underlying matching logic:

- **PixlHub Native Format (Recommended):** This is the most accurate method. It uses **Unique IDs** to match annotations directly to the specific asset and label schema. It is highly recommended for project migrations or backups.
- **External Formats (COCO & YOLO):** These formats rely on **Filename Matching**. While convenient for importing data from other platforms, this method is less precise as it can be affected by duplicate filenames across different folders.

> **Note:** For the best accuracy and to avoid issues with duplicate filenames, use the PixlHub Native format whenever possible.

### **Import History**

Every import attempt is logged in the **Import History** table, providing a full audit trail of external data additions. This table includes:

- **Date & Format:** When the import occurred and which file type was used.
- **Status:** Whether the import was successful, failed, or completed with warnings.
- **Imported vs. Total:** A comparison of the number of annotations successfully added versus the total found in the file.
- **Matched Tasks:** The number of tasks that successfully received new labels.
- **Errors:** A detailed count of any issues encountered, allowing for quick troubleshooting of file formatting or naming conflicts.
