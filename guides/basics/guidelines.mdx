4. **Choose a Format:**
   - **PDF Guidelines:** A PDF file can be uploaded directly to provide detailed visual instructions and edge-case examples.

### **Viewing Guidelines During Labeling**

Once assigned, guidelines are immediately available to annotators without them having to leave the labeling environment:

- **Accessing the Guide:** While inside the **Annotation Tool**, users can click the **Guidelines** tab located in the **Right Drawer**.
- **On-the-fly Reference:** This allows annotators to double-check labeling rules, class definitions, or specific object boundaries while they are actively working on a task.
