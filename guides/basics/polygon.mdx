### **Getting Started**

- **Tool Selection:** The Polygon Tool is selected via the **Smart Tool Palette**.
- **Efficiency (Tool Persistence):** To speed up the workflow, the last selected tool remains active by default. There is no need to re-select the Polygon Tool after completing a shape; the user can immediately begin drawing the next object.
- **Closing a Shape:** A polygon can be finalized in two ways:
  1. Clicking back on the **starting point** (the first node).
  2. Pressing the **Enter** key to automatically close the shape from the last point to the first.

### **Interactive Toolbar: Polygon Modes**

When the Polygon Tool is active, the **Interactive Toolbar** provides four specialized modes to handle overlapping shapes and complex geometries. These modes allow users to manage how new polygons interact with existing ones:

1. **Overwrite:** The default mode. New polygons are drawn independently, regardless of existing annotations.
2. **Subtract:** Used to cut out a section from an existing polygon. This is ideal for creating "holes" or removing specific parts from a larger shape (e.g., labeling a donut shape).
3. **Auto Subtract:** A smart mode that automatically trims the new polygon so it does not overlap with existing shapes, ensuring perfectly aligned boundaries without manual effort.
4. **Union:** Allows for the merging of two or more polygons. When used, the new shape is combined with a selected existing polygon to form a single, unified logical entity.

### **Precision & Speed**

The tool is optimized for high-speed vertex placement. Whether defining a simple triangle or a complex 100-point boundary, the canvas remains responsive, allowing for professional-grade segmentation at scale.
