### **Usage and Conversion**

- **Drawing Process:** Unlike the click-by-click method of the Polygon Tool, the Freeform Tool allows users to draw shapes freely as if using a pen.
- **Auto-Conversion:** Once the stroke is completed, the platform utilizes a path simplification algorithm to automatically convert the freehand drawing into a structured **Polygon**. This ensures that the final annotation remains editable and compatible with standard segmentation formats.
- **Finalizing:** Releasing the mouse button or closing the loop automatically triggers the conversion process.

### **Interactive Toolbar: Drawing Modes**

The Freeform Tool shares the same operational flexibility as the Polygon Tool. Through the **Interactive Toolbar**, users can select from four distinct modes:

1. **Overwrite:** The new shape is drawn independently.
2. **Subtract:** The freehand stroke cuts out a section from an existing polygon.
3. **Auto Subtract:** The platform automatically trims the freeform shape so it does not overlap with existing boundaries.
4. **Union:** The new freeform shape is merged into a single logical entity with an existing polygon.

### **Customization: Point Density**

The precision of the freeform-to-polygon conversion can be adjusted to match the complexity of the object:

- **Point Frequency:** Users can control how many vertices are generated during the conversion. A higher density captures more detail, while a lower density creates a simpler, more manageable polygon.
- **Configuration:** These settings are located under the **Freeform Settings** section within the **Canvas Settings** menu. Adjusting the frequency allows for a perfect balance between speed and geometric accuracy.
