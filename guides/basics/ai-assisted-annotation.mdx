### **Local Inference & Privacy**

All AI models within PixlHub are modified for optimized performance and run **locally**. The platform does not send data to external APIs or third-party servers. This ensures that even when using AI-assisted tools, sensitive data remains entirely within the local environment.

### **Smart AI Tools**

The following models are accessible via the **Smart Tool Palette**:

**1. Polygon from BBox** This tool combines the speed of a bounding box with the precision of a polygon.

- **Workflow:** The user draws a standard box around an object.
- **AI Action:** The model instantly identifies the object's boundaries within that box and converts it into a high-fidelity **Polygon**. This is ideal for quickly segmenting objects with complex edges.

**2. Auto-Detect Objects (Local YOLO)** Designed for high-volume initial labeling, this tool can populate an entire image with annotations in a single click.

- **Workflow:** Activate the tool with one click on the canvas.
- **AI Action:** Utilizing a modified **YOLO** model, the platform detects all recognizable objects in the frame and automatically labels them as **Bounding Boxes** based on the selected label schema.
