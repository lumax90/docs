### **Local Inference & Privacy**

All AI models within PixlHub are modified for optimized performance and run **locally**. The platform does not send data to external APIs or third-party servers. This ensures that even when using AI-assisted tools, sensitive data remains entirely within the local environment.

### **Smart AI Tools**

The following models are accessible via the **Smart Tool Palette**:

**1. Polygon from BBox** This tool combines the speed of a bounding box with the precision of a polygon.

- **Workflow:** The user draws a standard box around an object.
- **AI Action:** The model instantly identifies the object's boundaries within that box and converts it into a high-fidelity **Polygon**. This is ideal for quickly segmenting objects with complex edges.

**2. Auto-Detect Objects (Local YOLO)** Designed for high-volume initial labeling, this tool can populate an entire image with annotations in a single click.

- **Workflow:** Activate the tool with one click on the canvas.
- **AI Action:** Utilizing a modified **YOLO** model, the platform detects all recognizable objects in the frame and automatically labels them as **Bounding Boxes** based on the selected label schema.

**3. Smart Segment (Local SAM)** This tool allows for complex segmentation with zero manual tracing.

- **Workflow:** The user places a single **Point** on the target object.
- **AI Action:** Powered by a modified **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**, the AI identifies the entire structure of the object and wraps it in a precise **Polygon**. It is the most efficient way to label irregular shapes with a single click.

### **Workflow Integration**

AI-generated labels are treated as standard annotations. Once the AI provides a prediction, annotators can manually refine, resize, or delete the results just like any other label. This "Human-in-the-loop" approach ensures that speed never comes at the expense of accuracy.
