### **Activation & Setup**

The OCR functionality is linked to the Bounding Box tool. To enable it:

1. **Select BBox:** Choose the Bounding Box from the **Smart Tool Palette**.
2. **Toggle OCR Mode:** In the **Interactive Toolbar** (at the top), switch the mode from a standard BBox to an **OCR Box**.

Once active, any box drawn on the canvas is treated as a text detection region.

### **Scanning Modes**

PixlHub provides two ways to process text, allowing for both manual control and high-volume automation:

- **Manual Scan:** After drawing a box, right-click to open the **Context Menu** and select **"Scan"**. This triggers the recognition engine for that specific region.
- **Auto-Scan:** For faster workflows, the **Auto-Scan** option can be toggled on via the Interactive Toolbar. When enabled, PixlHub automatically performs text extraction the moment a box is completed, instantly populating the associated text field.

### **Privacy & Security (Local Inference)**

To meet the requirements of high-security environments and sensitive data projects, the OCR engine is built with a "security-first" architecture:

- **Local Models:** All recognition is performed using modified OCR models running locally on the system.
- **No External Dependencies:** The process does not rely on third-party APIs or external cloud connections.
- **Data Sovereignty:** Since no data is transmitted to external servers, the OCR tool is fully compliant with strict data privacy regulations, ensuring that sensitive information never leaves the local environment.
