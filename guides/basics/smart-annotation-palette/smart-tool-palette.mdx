title: "Smart Tool Palette"
description: "The Smart Annotation Palette is the central interface for all drawing and interaction tasks on the canvas. Unlike traditional labeling environments that restrict a project to a single tool type, this palette provides a versatile toolkit that supports multiple geometry types within the same workspace."

### **Dynamic Tool Selection**

PixlHub allows the label schema to evolve without constant configuration changes. This means a single project is not limited to just one type of annotation (e.g., Bounding Boxes only); managers and annotators can utilize a variety of tools as the project requirements grow.

The palette includes the following essential tools:

- **Bounding Box (BBox):** The standard tool for object detection and localization.
- **Polygon:** For high-precision instance or semantic segmentation of complex shapes.
- **Freeform:** A flexible drawing tool for tracing irregular boundaries manually.
- **Line & Point:** Specialized tools for keypoint detection, skeletal structures, or boundary markings.
- **Comments:** A collaboration tool to place feedback markers directly onto specific coordinates.
- **AI Predictions:** An assistive feature that utilizes pre-trained models to generate label suggestions, significantly reducing manual effort.

### **Operational Flexibility**

The primary advantage of the Smart Annotation Palette is its adaptability. New label types can be introduced into an existing project seamlessly. Whether the goal is to add a few keypoints to a bounding box project or to transition into full-scale segmentation, the palette ensures that the workflow remains uninterrupted and the label schema stays flexible.
