### **Usage**

- **Tool Selection:** Like other annotation tools, the Line Tool is accessed via the **Smart Palette**.
- **Drawing:** Users can place consecutive points on the canvas to define the path of the line. The interface maintains high precision for both straight and multi-segmented lines.
- **Finalizing:** To complete a line segment, users can press the **Enter** key or double-click the final point.

### **Common Use Cases**

While simple in nature, the Line Tool is frequently used for:

- **Road Markings:** Defining lanes and dividers in autonomous driving datasets.
- **Boundaries:** Marking fences, walls, or architectural edges.
- **Skeletonization:** Connecting keypoints to represent human or animal structures.

### **Flexibility**

As part of the **Smart Annotation Palette**, the Line Tool can be used interchangeably with other tools like Bounding Boxes or Polygons within the same project. This allows for comprehensive labeling of complex scenes where different geometry types are required.
