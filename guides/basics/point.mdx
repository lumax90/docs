### **Usage**

- **Tool Selection:** The Point Tool can be activated via the **Smart Palette**.
- **Placement:** Users can place a point by simply clicking on the target coordinate on the canvas. Each point acts as an independent annotation linked to the defined label schema.
- **Precision:** The tool is designed to provide pixel-perfect accuracy, ensuring that the landmark is placed exactly where the user intends.

### **Customization: Point Size**

To accommodate different image resolutions and visual requirements, the visibility of points can be adjusted:

- **Adjustable Size:** The diameter of the points on the canvas is not fixed. Users can increase or decrease the point size to ensure they are clearly visible or to avoid obscuring fine details of the underlying asset.
- **How to Change:** Point size settings are located under the **Canvas Settings** menu within the annotation interface. Adjusting this setting updates all points on the canvas in real-time.

### **Common Use Cases**

The Point Tool is the primary choice for:

- **Facial Landmarks:** Marking specific features like eyes, nose, or mouth corners.
- **Human Pose Estimation:** Identifying joints and skeletal keypoints.
- **Small Object Localization:** Pinpointing small or distant objects where a bounding box might be unnecessary.
