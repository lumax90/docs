### **Creating a New Organization**

A new organization can be initiated from two primary locations:

1. **Organization Switcher:** Click the **"+ Create Workspace"** option within the organization dropdown in the top navigation bar.
2. **User Profile:** Navigate to the **Organizations** section under the profile menu and click **"Create Organization."**

After entering a name and a brief description, the organization is created. To enter the new workspace, select it from the list and click the **"Switch to This"** button.

### **Managing Team Members**

Users are added to an organization via email invitations through the **Members** tab on the organization page.

**Organizational Roles:**

- **Member:** The default role. Members can participate in projects they are specifically invited to but cannot modify organization-level settings.
- **Admin:** Admins have full visibility and control over all projects, datasets, and settings within the organization. Because an Admin can modify or delete any resource, this role should be assigned with caution.

### **Project-Level Access**

Joining an organization does not automatically grant access to its projects. To maintain data security and focus, users must be invited to specific projects individually. Project-level roles include:

- **Labeler:** Authorized to annotate and submit tasks.
- **Reviewer:** Authorized to inspect, approve, or reject submitted annotations.
- **Manager:** Authorized to manage project settings, ontology, and team assignments.

### **Handling Invitations**

When a user is invited to a new organization or project, PixlHub sends a notification to keep them informed:

- **Visual Indicators:** A small **orange badge** appears on the user’s avatar as a persistent reminder of pending invitations.
- **Accepting Invites:** Users can view and respond to these invitations through the **Notifications** panel. Access to the workspace or project is granted immediately upon acceptance.
